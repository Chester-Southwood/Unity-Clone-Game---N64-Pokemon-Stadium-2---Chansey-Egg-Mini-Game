# Chansey Mini Game Clone (Pokemon Stadium 2 from N64)

![](https://www.serebii.net/stadium2/chansey.jpg)

This is a basic clone that uses the fundemental layout of the game, with enemies dropping from the air and chansey jumping into the air temporarily when struck. I spent part of a Friday evening and part of Saturday on this project. (2022-06-11)

# What I learned/Project doing this project
* Practiced Singleton Pattern
* Practice layout of Unity IDE
* Practice C# Properties
* Practice DoTween, heavily experimented at first when started project with player character, introduced with DoTween Visual Editor

# TODOS
[] Clean up UI - Make it dynamically sizable for whatever monitor / Web GL / Mobile Device
[] Play around with different enemy patterns/speeds - Create Modes
[] Create Pause Menu
[] Create Start Menu
[] Create Game Over Menu (For both success or failure)
[] Use Save System for Configurations / High Score
